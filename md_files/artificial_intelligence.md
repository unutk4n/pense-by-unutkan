# A Brief Lesson of AI

## What is AI?

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a set of technologies that enable computers to perform a variety of advanced functions, including the ability to see, understand and translate spoken and written language, analyze data, make recommendations, and more. 

So what does it mean in a more humanoid way?
We can think AI as a person. With today's technology we educate a computer in order to make decisions.
Think about a new born baby. When he/she was born, the baby didn't know anything. In time, the baby learns how to walk, eat, speak and so on.
The AI is being thought by us. It will learn anything we want. If it has the appropiate hardware like legs or hands it can run, hold something or even play table tennis or football.
Lots of people doesn't accept it to compare it with a human but in the end of the day we have lots in common.

# How can we use it and do we need to?

With technology evolving every single day, things get fast.
We don't need to go back hundreds of years to see how fast technology is evolving. Just 10 years ago we would get a new phone model every year only once. Now I can't follow it. 

We don't have the time to deal with electing spam email with necessary ones. 
We don't have the time to find an important chapter in a book.
We don't have time to prepare long presentations. Well I prepared this one but not because I have time. (LOL)
The thing I'm trying to express here is that things go fast and everyone became faster in any way. 
We have to be both efficient and fast.

So how can we use AI in order to become fast and efficient?
I'm not going to say how to select important emails because almost every email application is doing it by itself.

Let's say that I have 700 pages long book which has some useful information about some topic. In my case let's say phishing emails. I just 

Let's say that I need to learn a something and don't have the resourses for it. Usually the first thing I will do would be googling it. Sometimes we just can't understand what is written on web pages. In that case I'd open chatgpt and ask the question with adding the phrase " can you explain it as easy as possible and make it short please?"
Let's say that you didn't understand it again. You can just ask it to "can you explain it another way?"

Here I am going to make a quick start with some videos. I'll probably spend 10 hours for the fundamental beginning. If things go as I imagine, I'll carry on.

A machine is said ti have artificial intelligence if it can interpret data, potentially learn from the data, and use that knowledge to adapt and achieve specific goals.

The learning from the data is a new approach.

I've watched two videos so far.
Things we learned: The AI revolutions is happening is because we have data more than we need. Social Media and Internet allows us to have this data. We have super fast computers that can process data faster than anything.
