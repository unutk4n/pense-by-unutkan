# A Brief Lesson of AI

## What is AI?

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a set of technologies that enable computers to perform a variety of advanced functions, including the ability to see, understand and translate spoken and written language, analyze data, make recommendations, and more. 

So what does it mean in a more humanoid way?
We can think AI as a person. With today's technology we educate a computer in order to make decisions.
Think about a new born baby. When he/she was born, the baby didn't know anything. In time, the baby learns how to walk, eat, speak and so on.
The AI is being thought by us. It will learn anything we want. If it has the appropiate hardware like legs or hands it can run, hold something or even play table tennis or football.
Lots of people doesn't accept it to compare it with a human but in the end of the day we have lots in common.

# How can we use it and do we need to?

With technology evolving every single day, things get fast.
We don't need to go back hundreds of years to see how fast technology is evolving. Just 10 years ago we would get a new phone model every year only once. Now I can't follow it. 

We don't have the time to deal with electing spam email with necessary ones. 
We don't have the time to find an important chapter in a book.
We don't have time to prepare long presentations. Well I prepared this one but not because I have time. (LOL)
The thing I'm trying to express here is that things go fast and everyone became faster in any way. 
We have to be both efficient and fast.

So how can we use AI in order to become fast and efficient?
I'm not going to say how to select important emails because almost every email application is doing it by itself.

Let's say that I have 700 pages long book which has some useful information about some topic. In my case let's say phishing emails. I just 

Let's say that I need to learn a something and don't have the resourses for it. Usually the first thing I will do would be googling it. Sometimes we just can't understand what is written on web pages. In that case I'd open chatgpt and ask the question with adding the phrase " can you explain it as easy as possible and make it short please?"
Let's say that you didn't understand it again. You can just ask it to "can you explain it another way?"

Here I am going to make a quick start with some videos. I'll probably spend 10 hours for the fundamental beginning. If things go as I imagine, I'll carry on.

A machine is said to have artificial intelligence if it can interpret data, potentially learn from the data, and use that knowledge to adapt and achieve specific goals.

The learning from the data is a new approach.

book recommendation (quite old so it won't help todays AI): A PROPOSAL FOR THE DARTHMOUTH SUMMER RESERACH PROJECT ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE - MCCARTHY

I've watched two videos so far.
Things we learned: The AI revolutions is happening  because we have data more than we need. Social Media and Internet allows us to have this data. We have super fast computers that can process data faster than anything.

There are three main types of learning:
- Reinforcement
- Unsupervised
- supervised

Reinforcement : The process of learning in an environment through feedback from an AI's behavior
Unsupervised: The process of learning without training labels
supervised: The process of learning with labels

 Precision tells us how much you should trust your program when it says it's found something
 Recall tells you how much your program can find of the thing you're looking for
 Figuring out what criteria to use is the key to must AI challenges.
 Generally more inouts are better for accuracy but the AI will need more processing power and time to make decisions.


 ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK : This term is important. As we have seen in the previous video, the robot was making decisions with only one perceptron (the thing which decides what is what). With artificial neural networks we can do that in an advanced way.

 Not long ago the biggest challange was real-world image recognition like recognition a dog, cat etc.

without AI, a computer could tell if two seperate pictures were the same by comparing every single pixel but it couldn't tell different dog pictures if the objects were dogs.

imagenet is an important webpage that has thousands of pictures with labelled data.

Artificial Neural Network is a Network with more than 3 layers. 1 input 1 -probably more- hidden layer 1 output layer.
Every single layer has several outputs which is between 0 and 1. If it gets closer to 1 that means the picture, image or data is the defined data. If it's closer to 0 it means it's probably not the defined data. That's used in Deep Learning. Every single layer has a mathmatical function, which requires speed and power in computer

Neural networks handle mistakes by using an algorithm called backpropagation to make sure all the neurons that contributed to an error get their math adjustet.
But we won't dive deeper today.


With linear regression we draw a line -kind of randomly- and we calculate how much wrong it is we want the line to 
fit the best result and it's called the line of best fit

To give more accuracy we might need to give more than two features 
in case of a swimming pool user data
we can use the temperature and people count 
it will probably give us a good result but if we want to go further with the results we might need to add the humidity rate
or the water temperature 
Please also note that if we add more features the data gets tougher and it might get trickier so you should act wise before 
adding these features. 
So if we give a graph more features it will become complicated and hard to understand. At this point this is where neural
networks come in handy. basically we can't use multi features at a graph but a neural network can do that easily.

Loss function: So after training the neural network it will give us an output data and for the swimming pool case let's 
say that the ouput was 145 but the attendance was 100 so in this case 145-100 = 45 . So the number 45 is the result of the 
loss function and in order to make it more accurate we us  a function called backpropagation of the error or just backpropagation
The basic goal is to look at the loss function and then assign blame to neurons back in the previous layers of the network
Some neurons' calculations may have been more to blame than the others This information is fed backwards, which is where the idea
of backpropagation comes from  
Remember: our goal is to find the best combination of weights to get the lowest error 

Local optimal solution : I understood the basics of that but making an explanation is not the easiest thing right now


Also in order to predict how many person will use the pool we need to know the previous results of the count.
if we don't give enough data to the neural network it won't be able to predict correctly. 
Keep the network as easy as possible


If you can't understand don't worry about this explanation is not related with the case:
Açıklamaları yer yer türkçe yapsam nasıl olur diye düşünüyorum ancak karar veremedim. Bazen Türkçe dilinde devam etmenin daha verimli olacağını düşünsem de ulaşabildiğim kaynakların İngilizce olması ve Bu alanda ilerleyen bir çok insanın da İngilizce terimler kullanması beni Türkçe açılama yapmaktan uzaklaştırıyor. Bundan dolayı elimden geldiğince açıklamalarımı İngilizce yapacağım.

So far this course focused on artificial intelligence that uses Supervised Learning.
Supervised leaning needs a teacher to use labeled data to tell them.
It's like a classroom but we can learn without a classroom. So can unsupervised learning too.
